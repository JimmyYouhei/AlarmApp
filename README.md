# AlarmAppTraining

This is my project to make an Alarm App for Android:

The project was made by Android Studio 3.2 (Recently updated not originally )
The Compiled SDK was API 27: Android 8.1 Oreo (I tried to use API 28 but it seem to be unstable )
min SDK: 17

Note: please leave your window volume at least 70 or more as the alarm sound is intentionally to be low in volume 

I will make a more detail README later as it is just an incomplete README for learning purpose
